<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
 This was my first portfolio design and although it may not seem like much, it was a great accomplishment for myself. 
 
 Over the course of my journey I have struggled to create a portfolio that I am satisfied with.

This portfolio quickly got replaced, but despite this. I'm happy with the animation and overall result of the page!
